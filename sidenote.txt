Packaging on NixOS i've found to be annoying for C# because there's no clear solution for dependencies.

Therefore, here are the steps I took:

dotnet restore --packages ./deps -f
nix-shell -p nuget-to-nix
nuget-to-nix ./deps > deps.nix
rm -rd ./deps
Then open deps.nix and replace `name` with `pname`.
